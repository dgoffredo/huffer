Huffman Trees
=============
`tree.cpp` is a program that creates a Huffman tree from standard input and
prints the tree as a graph to standard output.

For example,

> foobar

![foobar Huffman tree](examples/foobar.svg)

> Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that
> Mary went the lamb was sure to go.

![Mary had a little Huffman tree](examples/mary.svg)
